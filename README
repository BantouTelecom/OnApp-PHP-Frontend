OnApp PHP Frontend is a web application that enables you to customize and extend OnApp Cloud functionality. The application is written in PHP, and connects to OnApp Cloud via the OnApp API.
OnApp PHP Frontend operates in much the same way as OnApp Cloud’s Control Panel (“OnApp CP”), but has some additional useful features, such as:
The ability to customize the interface with your own smarty templates
Open code, making it possible to add/customize new controllers
Multi-language support
Detailed error and debug logs
Mail templates
… and much more in future versions of the software. Upcoming releases will include Event Manager.
